Pattern Recognition tool to optimize transmission of overlapping image data between wireless sensors in a remote location

Application runs on a remote server and reads in data samples for a given period of time from two randomly oriented wireless image sensors and tries to compute potential overlap in image captured by the sensors.

Finding overlaps in transmission of images between several sensors can help instruct those sensors to not transmit redundant information thereby reducing power consumption and improving sensors' lives

Quality assessment tests are run on predetermined datasets to ensure standards for this pattern recoginition tool.

Image datasets to run simulations on and statistical reports generated are available upon request.
